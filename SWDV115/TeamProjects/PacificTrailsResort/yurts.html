            <dt><strong>What is a yurt?</strong></dt>
            <dd>Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground. Each yurt is fully enclosed with
                canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a roof dome that can be opened.</dt>
            <dt><strong>How are the yurts furnished?</strong></dt>
            <dd>Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down quilt and gas-fired stove. Your luxury camping
                experience includes electricity and a sink with hot and cold running water. Shower and restroom
                facilities are located in the lodge.</dt>
            <dt><strong>What should I bring?</strong></dt>
            <dd>Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing weather with light layers of
                clothing. It&#39;s also helpful to bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!</dt>
