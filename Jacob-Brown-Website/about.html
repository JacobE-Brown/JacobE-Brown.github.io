				<h2>About Jacob Brown</h2>
			<p>I first graduated from <i>Magdalen College</i> in May of 2023 with a degree in the <em>Liberal Arts majoring in History</em>. From my Alma Mater I learned how to read and write well while also immersing myself in the classics. </p>
			<p>I must also say of myself that after graduation I got married to Brianna Brown in May of 2023. As <cite>Jane Austen</cite> once said: </p>
				<blockquote>“It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.” (Austen, <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>, <cite>Canturbery classics</cite>, 1)</blockquote>
			<p>Well, I must acknowledge that it is a universal truth that a married man in possesion of a good wife, must be in need of a good fortune. Now I am taking the <strong>Software Development course (SWDV)</strong> from the <i>College of Western Idaho</i> (CWI) in order to earn that fortune.</p>
		<h3>Random Quotes For Fun</h3>
			<p>Because of my liberal arts degree, I might as well put in some entertaining stuff for anyone interested.</p>
				<strong>Today’s quote:</strong> 
					<blockquote>“Nothing is so trivial as treating serious subjects in a trivial manner; and similarly, nothing is more entertaining than treating trivialities in such a way as to make it clear you are doing anything but trifle with them.” (Erasmus, <cite>Praise of Folly</cite>, <cite>Penguin Classics</cite>, 6)</blockquote>
