alert("Welcome to my Week 1-2 Project! The main javascript I did was to make a navigation menu in chrome web tools for when the screen size was under 426px. This was done to make sure that the menu would appear and disapear when clicking the hamburger button. In the header I made the text float over the js <canvas> with some ChatGPT Javascript code as a placeholder for my own untill I can put in my own in the future. I hope that fulfills the Javascript Requirement.");
