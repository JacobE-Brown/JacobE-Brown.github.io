Pure CSS is based upun Normalize.css, which aims to make browsers render elements more consistently.

"At the time of writing, normalize.css is used in some form by Twitter Bootstrap, HTML5 Boilerplate, GOV.UK, Rdio, CSS Tricks, 
and many other frameworks, toolkits, and sites." https://nicolasgallagher.com/about-normalize-css/

To use Pure SCC, use the normalize link here: <link rel="stylesheet" 
href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/purecss@3.0.0/build/base-min.css">

To use pure grids, You need two tags:

pure-g and pure-u-*
and pure-u can be made to respond to specific screens by puting in a screen size into the class name:
pure-u-sm-*

pure-g creates the grid element and the pure-u are the units that the children ocupy in the grid.

The elements are made by fractions, so if you wanted to make a half it would be 1-2, or a third 1-3.
pure-u-1-3


Pure Forms:
Allows you to set up your forms with pre made common styles by use of the pure-form class on the form element.

There are many applications, including pure-form-aligned, that allines all the elements and labels neatly in the middle of the element.
