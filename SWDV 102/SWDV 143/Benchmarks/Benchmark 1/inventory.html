                    <h2>Sunday Morning <br />By Wallace Stevens</h2>

                    <h3>I</h3>
                    <p>Complacencies of the peignoir, and late</p>
                    <p>Coffee and oranges in a sunny chair,</p>
                    <p>And the green freedom of a cockatoo</p>
                    <p>Upon a rug mingle to dissipate</p>
                    <p>The holy hush of ancient sacrifice.</p>
                    <p>She dreams a little, and she feels the dark</p>
                    <p>Encroachment of that old catastrophe,</p>
                    <p>As a calm darkens among water-lights.</p>
                    <p>The pungent oranges and bright, green wings</p>
                    <p>Seem things in some procession of the dead,</p>
                    <p>Winding across wide water, without sound.</p>
                    <p>The day is like wide water, without sound,</p>
                    <p>Stilled for the passing of her dreaming feet</p>
                    <p>Over the seas, to silent Palestine,</p>
                    <p>Dominion of the blood and sepulchre.</p>

                    <h3>II</h3>
                    <p>Why should she give her bounty to the dead?</p>
                    <p>What is divinity if it can come</p>
                    <p>Only in silent shadows and in dreams?</p>
                    <p>Shall she not find in comforts of the sun,</p>
                    <p>In pungent fruit and bright, green wings, or else</p>
                    <p>In any balm or beauty of the earth,</p>
                    <p>Things to be cherished like the thought of heaven?</p>
                    <p>Divinity must live within herself:</p>
                    <p>Passions of rain, or moods in falling snow;</p>
                    <p>Grievings in loneliness, or unsubdued</p>
                    <p>Elations when the forest blooms; gusty</p>
                    <p>Emotions on wet roads on autumn nights;</p>
                    <p>All pleasures and all pains, remembering</p>
                    <p>The bough of summer and the winter branch.</p>
                    <p>These are the measures destined for her soul.</p>

                    <h3>III</h3>
                    <p>Jove in the clouds had his inhuman birth.</p>
                    <p>No mother suckled him, no sweet land gave</p>
                    <p>Large-mannered motions to his mythy mind.</p>
                    <p>He moved among us, as a muttering king,</p>
                    <p>Magnificent, would move among his hinds,</p>
                    <p>Until our blood, commingling, virginal,</p>
                    <p>With heaven, brought such requital to desire</p>
                    <p>The very hinds discerned it, in a star.</p>
                    <p>Shall our blood fail? Or shall it come to be</p>
                    <p>The blood of paradise? And shall the earth</p>
                    <p>Seem all of paradise that we shall know?</p>
                    <p>The sky will be much friendlier then than now,</p>
                    <p>A part of labor and a part of pain,</p>
                    <p>And next in glory to enduring love,</p>
                    <p>Not this dividing and indifferent blue.</p>

                    <h3>IV</h3>
                    <p>She says, “I am content when wakened birds,</p>
                    <p>Before they fly, test the reality</p>
                    <p>Of misty fields, by their sweet questionings;</p>
                    <p>But when the birds are gone, and their warm fields</p>
                    <p>Return no more, where, then, is paradise?”</p>
                    <p>There is not any haunt of prophecy,</p>
                    <p>Nor any old chimera of the grave,</p>
                    <p>Neither the golden underground, nor isle</p>
                    <p>Melodious, where spirits gat them home,</p>
                    <p>Nor visionary south, nor cloudy palm</p>
                    <p>Remote on heaven’s hill, that has endured</p>
                    <p>As April’s green endures; or will endure</p>
                    <p>Like her remembrance of awakened birds,</p>
                    <p>Or her desire for June and evening, tipped</p>
                    <p>By the consummation of the swallow’s wings.</p>

                    <h3>V</h3>
                    <p>She says, “But in contentment I still feel</p>
                    <p>The need of some imperishable bliss.”</p>
                    <p>Death is the mother of beauty; hence from her,</p>
                    <p>Alone, shall come fulfilment to our dreams</p>
                    <p>And our desires. Although she strews the leaves</p>
                    <p>Of sure obliteration on our paths,</p>
                    <p>The path sick sorrow took, the many paths</p>
                    <p>Where triumph rang its brassy phrase, or love</p>
                    <p>Whispered a little out of tenderness,</p>
                    <p>She makes the willow shiver in the sun</p>
                    <p>For maidens who were wont to sit and gaze</p>
                    <p>Upon the grass, relinquished to their feet.</p>
                    <p>She causes boys to pile new plums and pears</p>
                    <p>On disregarded plate. The maidens taste</p>
                    <p>And stray impassioned in the littering leaves.</p>

                    <h3>VI</h3>
                    <p>Is there no change of death in paradise?</p>
                    <p>Does ripe fruit never fall? Or do the boughs</p>
                    <p>Hang always heavy in that perfect sky,</p>
                    <p>Unchanging, yet so like our perishing earth,</p>
                    <p>With rivers like our own that seek for seas</p>
                    <p>They never find, the same receding shores</p>
                    <p>That never touch with inarticulate pang?</p>
                    <p>Why set the pear upon those river-banks</p>
                    <p>Or spice the shores with odors of the plum?</p>
                    <p>Alas, that they should wear our colors there,</p>
                    <p>The silken weavings of our afternoons,</p>
                    <p>And pick the strings of our insipid lutes!</p>
                    <p>Death is the mother of beauty, mystical,</p>
                    <p>Within whose burning bosom we devise</p>
                    <p>Our earthly mothers waiting, sleeplessly.</p>

                    <h3>VII</h3>
                    <p>Supple and turbulent, a ring of men</p>
                    <p>Shall chant in orgy on a summer morn</p>
                    <p>Their boisterous devotion to the sun,</p>
                    <p>Not as a god, but as a god might be,</p>
                    <p>Naked among them, like a savage source.</p>
                    <p>Their chant shall be a chant of paradise,</p>
                    <p>Out of their blood, returning to the sky;</p>
                    <p>And in their chant shall enter, voice by voice,</p>
                    <p>The windy lake wherein their lord delights,</p>
                    <p>The trees, like serafin, and echoing hills,</p>
                    <p>That choir among themselves long afterward.</p>
                    <p>They shall know well the heavenly fellowship</p>
                    <p>Of men that perish and of summer morn.</p>
                    <p>And whence they came and whither they shall go</p>
                    <p>The dew upon their feet shall manifest.</p>

                    <h3>VIII</h3>
                    <p>She hears, upon that water without sound,</p>
                    <p>A voice that cries, “The tomb in Palestine</p>
                    <p>Is not the porch of spirits lingering.</p>
                    <p>It is the grave of Jesus, where he lay.”</p>
                    <p>We live in an old chaos of the sun,</p>
                    <p>Or old dependency of day and night,</p>
                    <p>Or island solitude, unsponsored, free,</p>
                    <p>Of that wide water, inescapable.</p>
                    <p>Deer walk upon our mountains, and the quail</p>
                    <p>Whistle about us their spontaneous cries;</p>
                    <p>Sweet berries ripen in the wilderness;</p>
                    <p>And, in the isolation of the sky,</p>
                    <p>At evening, casual flocks of pigeons make</p>
                    <p>Ambiguous undulations as they sink,</p>
                    <p>Downward to darkness, on extended wings.</p>
