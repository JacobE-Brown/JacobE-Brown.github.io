                    Parallax is a displacement or difference in the apparent
                    position of an object viewed along two different lines of
                    sight and is measured by the angle or half-angle of
                    inclination between those two lines.[1][2] Due to
                    foreshortening, nearby objects show a larger parallax than
                    farther objects, so parallax can be used to determine
                    distances.

                        The parallax formula states that the distance to a star
                        is equal to 1 divided by the parallax angle, p, where p
                        is measured in arc-seconds, and d is parsecs.

                    <h3>Explanation:</h3>
                    <p>
                        Parallax is a method of using two points of observation
                        to measure the distance to an object by observing how it
                        appears to move against a background. One way to
                        understand parallax is to look at a nearby object and
                        note its position against a wall. If you look with just
                        one eye, then the other, the object will appear to move
                        against the background.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Because your eyes are separated by several centimeters,
                        each eye has a different perspective of where the object
                        is relative to the background. The closer the object is,
                        the more it appears to move relative to the background.
                        This is true in astronomy as well, but on a much larger
                        scale.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In astronomy, the distances to other stars is too great
                        to measure using two objects on the Earth's surface.
                        Lucky for us, the Earth itself moves. If we made two
                        observations of the same star on opposite sides of the
                        Earth's orbit, we would have a separation of 2
                        astronomical units, or AU. One AU is the average
                        distance from the Sun to the Earth.

                    <p>
                        Aristotle argued that the earth cannot be in motion
                        because we do not observe any parallax in the stars. He
                        says:
                    </p>
                    <p class="container">
                        "The stars do not appear to move as we might suppose
                        from the Earth, but their motion is seen in a circular
                        motion around the center of the universe, and there is
                        no parallax from the fixed stars because they are so far
                        away." <br />

                    <p>
                        And this logic stood until 1838 Friedrich Bessel gave
                        the first direct obserbation of stellar parallax.

                                For the first time, a spacecraft has sent back
                                pictures of the sky from so far away that some
                                stars appear to be in different positions than
                                we’d see from Earth. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                On April 22-23, the spacecraft turned its
                                long-range telescopic camera to a pair of the
                                “closest” stars, Proxima Centauri and Wolf 359,
                                showing just how they appear in different places
                                than we see from Earth. Scientists have long
                                used this “parallax effect” – how a star appears
                                to shift against its background when seen from
                                different locations — to measure distances to
                                stars.
